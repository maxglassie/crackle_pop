# crackle_pop

This solves the age old programming problem known as "FizzBuzz" or "CracklePop" in LISP. I draw heavily from Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Chapter 2.2.3 - "Sequences as Conventional Interfaces." The basic pattern is a signal flow structure accumulate-map-filter-enumerate; this is one of my favorite parts of the book. In this instance, the accumulate function is not necessary.
